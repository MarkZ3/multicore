OpenCL example
===================

Download and install the [AMD APP SDK 3.0 for OpenCL](http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/opencl-zone/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/)

Configure the saxpy.pro file to match the installation directory of the SDK. The program should detect at least the CPU device. For actually using the GPU, the Catalyst driver is required.
